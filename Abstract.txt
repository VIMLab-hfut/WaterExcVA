With the continuous development of sensor, computer and other Internet of Things technology, intelligent water system has a rapid development. Water supply experts need to analyze the water supply data in time and make timely decisions on abnormal conditions to ensure the safety of water use and the stability of enterprise production.However, water affairs experts are faced with great challenges in decision-making, because with the continuous development of Internet of things technology, the amount of water supply data and the types of related data are increasing rapidly, the types of abnormal situations and the amount of data of influencing factors are also increasing, which makes decision-making in the real environment require a lot of human resources and time. This situation prompted us to cooperate with water affairs experts and put forward a visualization system based on data analysis of urban water supply network system.There are three main challenges in developing such a system: 1. Deep analysis of complex network structure; 2. Interactive generation of data comparison scheme; 3. Effective methods for analyzing the abnormal causes. For challenge 1, we use a customizable visual view from the whole to the details, which can customize and stratify the complex water structure system, so as to effectively explore the abnormal facilities and equipment. For challenge 3, we introduce the strategy of influence degree parameter to help users analyze the influence degree of different factors on water affairs data, and help users find the causes of anomalies.Based on the real business needs of water supply enterprises and water supply network data, the system is evaluated by case studies and analysis of water supply experts.
